# Standford CS224n

The three assignments are considered completed. In the future, following work on
the selected final project may be added here, too.

For each question in each assignment, besides the coding part, I usually have a
corresponding jupyter notebook to record my written answers. They main include
more details (e.g. backpropagation derivation) and could be used as in
complementary to the stanford solution files.
